# fork-origin

This repo is the original one for practicing forking and making pull-requests. This is a public repo.

> Alright. Now I have made some changes in the forked repo.


## Here's the 2nd content change in the forked repo, would it be conflict and how would the forked repo fetch commits from the original repo?

## Now the origin repo made another change, but how would the forked repo know that and update?
